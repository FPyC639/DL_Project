# Deep Learning DS 677-003 Class Project
## New Jersey Institute of Technology

Using the StarCoder Project our team of Avina, and Jose worked on generating a Code to Snippets, Snippets to Instructions, and Instructions to Responses from the BigCode Project template for the C++ language. Our team worked on first gathering seeds from a 2000 samples and captured 214 functions. Then we used an A100 GPU Cluster to run the code and perform the aforementioned task. On the Linux server we managed to get 202 Responses at the end of the project.
