Break down the integer into 5-bit chunks: Extract 5-bit chunks from the integer using `& 31` (`0x1F`), because the binary representation of `31` (`11111`) has the last five bits set, which will effectively extract the 5 bits we are interested in. We start from the least significant bits (LSB).\n","2.

Compared with a standard binary search that looks for an exact match, we can modify the algorithm such that when the target is not found, we return the `left` bound, which represents the index where the target can be inserted to maintain the array's sorted order.

This is because at the end of the loop, all elements to the left of `left` are smaller than `target`, all elements to the right of `left` are equal to or larger than `target`, and `left > right`.
